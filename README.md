- Phosphohydramine N-Oxide

### 常见别名 | Common Alias
- 水光素 | Hydrolux

### 描述 | Description
A novel psychoactive substance belonging to a hypothetical class of phosphorylated tryptamine-analogs. Synthesized through complex biomimetic processes combining phosphonate groups from the marine sponge *Psammocinia phosphora* with pre-oxidized tryptamine cores from the desert toad *Incilius illuminatus*. Anecdotal reports describe its effects as profoundly tranquil and hypnotic, characterized by vivid, aqueous visual phenomena of floating luminous script and a deep sense of metaphysical introspection.

一种属于假想的磷酸化色胺类似物类别的新型精神活性物质。通过复杂的仿生过程合成，结合了来自海洋海绵*Psammocinia phosphora*的磷酸基团和来自沙漠蟾蜍*Incilius illuminatus*的预氧化色胺核心。据传闻描述，其效果深沉宁静且具有催眠性，以生动的、水般的浮动发光文字视觉现象和深沉的形而上的内省感为特征。

**(Phosphohydramine N-Oxide | 磷氢胺N-氧化物)**

**合成 | SYNTHESIS**
源于海洋海绵*Psammocinia phosphora*的脂质提取物与沙漠蟾蜍*Incilius illuminatus*分泌物中的预氧化色胺核心，在极性非质子溶剂中耦合。反应放热并产生微弱的蓝绿色化学发光。产物以吸湿性白色晶体形式沉淀。
Sourced from lipid extracts of the marine sponge *Psammocinia phosphora* coupled with pre-oxidized tryptamine cores from secretions of the desert toad *Incilius illuminatus* in a polar aprotic solvent. The reaction is exothermic and produces faint blue-green chemiluminescence. The product precipitates as hygroscopic white crystals.

**定性评论 | QUALITATIVE COMMENTS**
**(8 mg)** "没有起效焦虑，这很不寻常。仅仅是内心独白的逐渐放缓。视觉领域变得微妙地像素化，但不是方块，而是缓慢漂移的、半透明的光球，蓝色和玫瑰色。移动的欲望或能力降至最低。这不是一种社交物质；它是一种用于'存在'而非'行动'的物质。"
"No come-up anxiety, which is unusual. It was simply a gradual slowing of the internal monologue. The visual field became subtly pixelated, not with squares, but with slowly drifting, translucent spheres of light, blue and rose-colored. The desire or ability to move was minimal. This is not a social substance; it is a substance for being, not for doing."

**(12 mg)** "我所经历过的最深刻的平静，但没有镇静作用。我感觉自己在一个无声飓风的静止中心。我自己的思绪没有狂奔；它们以三维、发光的结构排列在我周围，我可以毫无评判地观察。没有'迷幻旅程'，只有一种深化、一种静默。世界变得柔和而充满善意。这种状态的记忆具有持久的治疗价值。"
"The most profound peace I have ever known without sedation. I felt like I was at the still center of a silent hurricane. My own thoughts were not racing; they were arranged around me in three-dimensional, glowing structures that I could observe without judgment. There is no 'trip.' There is only a deepening, a quieting. The world becomes soft-focused and benevolent. The memory of this state has lasting therapeutic value."

**(18 mg)** "在这个剂量下，视觉成分变得主导。'漂浮球体'解析成只能被描述为缓慢移动的、发光的圆柱形文字流。字符无法识别，呈几何状，发出深邃的内在光芒，蓝色和红色。它们具有意识并能感知我的观察，当我的注意力穿过时会温柔地分开。这种体验如同被准许窥见现实的基本、和平的代码。没有困惑，只有敬畏和深沉、深沉的平静。"
"At this level, the visual component became dominant. The 'floating spheres' resolved into what can only be described as a slow-moving, cylindrical river of luminous script. The characters were unrecognizable, geometric, and glowed with a profound inner light, blue and red. They were conscious and aware of my observation, parting gently as my attention moved through them. The experience was one of being granted a glimpse into the fundamental, peaceful code of reality. There was no confusion, only awe and a deep, deep calm."
